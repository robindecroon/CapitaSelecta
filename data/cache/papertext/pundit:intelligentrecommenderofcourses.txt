3   Evaluation.
 Our evaluation strategy links every user in the system with every course, s/he has taken at Teachers College. We compared this information with recommendations from Pundit to determine the number of intersections. Before doing this, we removed transcripts and/or other course related information from user profiles to eliminate any bias towards the final results. The data used for evaluating the Pundit methodology consisted of 45,713 course files, 3,403 courses, 35,215 student & faculty, 40 user profiles, 74 degree programs, and 247 department. Figure 1 below shows the results we obtained when 200 recommended courses for 40 faculty member profiles were compared against the courses faculty previously taught.
