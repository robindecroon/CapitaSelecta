 Figure 1: Interaction between computer and teacher: explanation of a critical example. 
 An example interaction between the method and the teacher is shown in Fig. 1.  The teacher is presented with a critical example, i. e., the example where the current set of rules suggested a bad goal (“push black king to the edge of the board” can be achieved, but is not leading to solution). The teacher was therefore asked to provide a better goal for this position, which was then used in the construction of a new set of goal-based rules. The process was completed when all critical examples were explained by the expert. The final rules1 were presented to three chess teachers (among them a selector of Slovenian women's squad and a selector of Slovenian youth squad) to evaluate their appropriateness for teaching chess-players. They all agreed on the usefulness of the presented concepts and found the derived strategy suitable for educational purposes at the level targeted for. Among the reasons to support this assessment was that the instructions “clearly demonstrate the intermediate subgoals of delivering checkmate.”
